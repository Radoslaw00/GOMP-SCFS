Generic Orbital Maneuver Planner<br>Shuttle-Class Flight Subsystem
<br>
Welcome, this is my first ever portfolio project and part of a learning process.
I am in love with aerospace and decided to work on embedded projects in low level languages, because they have a real inpact in the real world. I was inspired to proceed work on my project and learn C because of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. There was a lot of tech in it that is still relatable in 2025 (and probably will be still relatable in YEARS to come).
I decided to start working on Generic Orbital Maneuver Planner - Shuttle-Class Flight Subsystem because it is very rellevant to my goals.
I will build this orbital flight subsystem to challange and test myslef and my determination and see how it will go.
I decided that I will put a lot of work and love into this project, even if I will not be able to properly test it on real hardware I will make it work this way or another at least in theory. I plan to learn and refrect on myself hopefully making it in embedded software engineering/development this way or another.<br><br>
TILL whenever I want (not my main project)
